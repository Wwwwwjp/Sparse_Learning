# Sparse_Learning
Undergraduate graduation project: Detailed research on the principles and characteristics of four sparse learning algorithms. Numerical experiments were conducted on two CV datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the four algorithms as embedded feature selection methods, and to compare and analyze the advantages with the deep learning algorithm CNN.
